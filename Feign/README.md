In Microservices architecture, there are number of individual services deployed separately on different servers. These services communicate with each other.

There are many solutions to achieve this communication, for example, JAX-RS client API, Spring RestTemplate, Apache HTTPClient etc.

Feign is a HTTP client for calling RESTful web services. It was developed by Netflix.

In this tutorial, we will see a practical example to understand how we can use Feign to achieve inter services communication.

You can go through my blog on [Introduction to Feign](https://nileshwaani.github.io/microservices/2019/02/17/Introduction-to-Feign.html).
